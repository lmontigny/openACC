    "## Why use Multiple GPUs?\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have accelerated your application using a single GPU, it's natural to consider extending your app to take advantage of multiple GPUs in a single node or in multiple nodes of a GPU accelerated cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple GPUs can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute Faster - More GPUs equals faster time to a solution\n",
    "* Compute Larger - More GPUs means more memory for larger problems\n",
    "* Compute Cheaper - More GPUs per node translates to less overhead in money, power and space\n",
    "\n",
    "Using CUDA-aware MPI with OpenACC allows you to efficiently utilize all the GPUs in a single node and also to scale across the GPUs in multiple nodes of a GPU accelerated cluster. If you are accelerating an (already) existing MPI parallel CPU code with OpenACC, going multi-GPU with CUDA-aware MPI and OpenACC is straight-forward.\n",

    "A CUDA-aware MPI implementation allows you to exchange data directly to and from the four gpu buffers involved, avoiding host buffer staging in the user code. For this lab it is sufficient to know that you can directly pass GPU pointers to the MPI routines of a CUDA-aware MPI implementation.

    "\n",
    "* Serial Time: $\\Large{T_{s}}$  - how long it takes to run the problem with a single thread\n",

For example, rank <code>i</code> needs to sent the first row it has modified to the last row (the bottom domain boundary (halo)) of rank <code>i-1</code> (top neighbour), and the last row it has modified to the first row (the top domain boundary (halo)) of rank rank <code>i+1</code> (bottom neighbour):\n",

This is ensured with the directive <code>host_data use_device</code>, which was already inserted into the source code for you. <code>host_data use_device(A)</code> tells the OpenACC compiler to use the device representation of <code>A</code> in the following code block. Because we are using a CUDA-aware MPI the MPI implementation can handle these and do the halo updates directly to and from GPU memory. Without <code>host_data use_device(A)</code> the host representations of <code>A</code> would be passed to MPI and thus stale data would be exchanged between buffers in host memory which are not being used during the iterations of the Jacobi solver. If you want, you can try to remove the <code> host_data use_device(A)</code> directive and see what happens.\n",

    "By applying a domain decomposition and distributing the work across multiple GPUs in task #2 we could get a speed-up but do not attain optimal efficiency. This is because of the time that is needed (spent) to carry out the halo updates using MPI. This wasted time is called \"parallel overhead\" because it is a step not necessary for execution with a single GPU. We can lower the parallel overhead by doing computations in parallel with the MPI communication and therefore hide the communication time. In the case of our Jacobi solver, this is best done by splitting each domain into a boundary part (which updates all values that we need to communicate) and an inner part. By doing this split, we can start the MPI communication after the boundary part has finished, and let it run in parallel with the inner part:\n",
