    "Open-specification OpenACC directives are a straightforward way to accelerate existing Fortran and C applications. With OpenACC directives, you provide hints via compiler directives (or 'pragmas') to tell the compiler where -- and how -- it should parallelize compute-intensive code for execution on an accelerator. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've done parallel programming using OpenMP, OpenACC is very similar: using directives, applications can be parallelized *incrementally*, with little or no change to the Fortran, C or C++ source. Debugging and code maintenance are easier. OpenACC directives are designed for *portability* across operating systems, host CPUs, and accelerators. You can use OpenACC directives with GPU accelerated libraries, explicit parallel programming languages (e.g., CUDA), MPI, and OpenMP, *all in the same program.*\n",

    "3. Minimize data movement\n",

    "The content of these steps and their order will be familiar if you have ever done parallel programming on other platforms. Parallel programmers deal with the same issues whenever they tackle a new set of code, no matter what platform they are parallelizing an application for. These issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ optimizing and benchmarking the serial version of an application\n",
    "+ profiling to identify the compute-intensive portions of the program that can be executed concurrently\n",
    "+ expressing concurrency using a parallel programming notation (e.g., OpenACC directives)\n",
    "+ compiling and benchmarking each new/parallel version of the application\n",
    "+ locating problem areas and making improvements iteratively until the target level of performance is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming manual for some other parallel platform you've used may have suggested five steps, or fifteen. Whether you are an expert or new to parallel programming, we recommend that you walk through the four steps here as a good way to begin accelerating applications by at least 2X using OpenACC directives. We believe *being more knowledgeable about the four steps* will make the process of programming for an accelerator more understandable *and* more manageable. The 2X in 4 Steps process will help you use OpenACC on your own codes more productively, and get significantly better speed-ups in less time."

With a simple code, you can identify which loops are candidates for acceleration with a little bit of code inspection. On more complex codes, a great way to find these computationally intense areas is to use a profiler (such as PGI's pgprof, NVIDIA's nvprof or open-source *gprof*) to determine which functions are consuming the largest amounts of compute time.

Return to your `PGPROF` window from earlier, start another new session, but this time loading `task2_out` as your executable (it's in the same directory as before). This time we'll find a colorful graph of what our program is doing, this is the GPU timeline. We can't tell much from the default view, but we can zoom in by using the `+` magnifying glass at the top of the window. If you zoom in far enough, you'll begin to see a pattern like the one in the screenshot below. The teal and purple boxes are the compute kernels that go with the two loops in our kernels region. Each of these groupings of kernels is surrounded by tan coloer boxes representing data movement. What this graph is showing us is that for every step of our `while` loop, we're copying data to the GPU and then back out. Let's try to figure out why.\n",

It knows we need the `A` and `Anew` arrays on the GPU for each of our two accelerated sections, but we didn't tell it anything about what happens to the data outside of those sections.  Without this knowledge, it has to copy the full arrays *to the GPU and back to the CPU* for each accelerated section, *every time* it went through the while loop.

The second region is the nested computation loop starting on line 44, which takes about 0.25 seconds. The copyback (*copyout*) loop then executes beginning with line 68.

The grid the compiler has constructed is also 2D, 32 blocks wide and 256 blocks tall. This is just enough to cover our 1024x1024 grid.
